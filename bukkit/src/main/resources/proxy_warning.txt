Server is in proxy mode!
If you are NOT using a proxy (Bungeecord, waterfall or velocity) in your network, set spigot.yml -> bungeecord: false

Are you using a proxy?
It's recommended to have the proxy handle SkinsRestorer's command's, API, permission, database and config using below seps:
Download the latest version from https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/skinsrestorer.2124/
Place the SkinsRestorer.jar in ./plugins/ folders of every Spigot server.
Place the plugin in ./plugins/ folder of every proxy server.
Check & set on every backend server spigot.yml -> bungeecord: true
Restart (/restart or /stop) all servers [Plugman or /reload are NOT supported, use /stop or /end]

Your proxy will now tell all your backend servers what to do!
You may now configure SkinsRestorer on your proxy (<proxy>/plugins/SkinsRestorer)

!== override files ==!
Warning: only use override files if you wish to run commands / API on backend, you need to uninstall sr from proxy and connect all backend to same mysql
How to urn off proxy mode: create a file called disableProxyMode.txt in SkinsRestorer folder (backend server -> ./plugins/SkinsRestorer/disableProxyMode.txt)
This will force disable proxy mode on next restart.
